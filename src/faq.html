				<div class="faq-question">
					Do I need a security audit?
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					If your smart contract or decentralized application will be handling any amount of significant funds in production, you need an audit to ensure that there are no vulnerabilities or exploits in the code. Trustless Design's talent is top-notch at catching hard-to-spot exploits that others miss.
				</div>

			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="faq-question">
					What is contained in the audit report?
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					We deliver an audit report which details our process and methods as we review your code and test the contracts. We highlight any vulnerabilities we may find and give suggestions about best practices and code style. With your permission, we prepare a blog post to share with our community about the findings of the audit.

			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="faq-question">
					How do you disclose the report?
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					We work closely with the client to follow the right disclosure strategy for them. Usually we will perform the audit and deliver the initial report to the team. After allowing for any necessary fixes or change to the code, we write a blog post about the overall result and publish it.
